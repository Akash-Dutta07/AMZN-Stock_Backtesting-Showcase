# AMZN-Stock_Backtesting-Showcase
# AMZN Stock Data Analysis and Simple Backtesting Showcase

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`amzn.ipynb`) demonstrating fundamental data analysis techniques on historical Amazon (AMZN) stock data, along with an initial exploration into basic backtesting concepts. This project serves as a foundation for more complex quantitative analysis and algorithmic trading strategy development.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to:
1.  Load and explore historical stock price data for Amazon (AMZN).
2.  Perform basic data manipulation and feature creation.
3.  Visualize key aspects of the stock's price movements.
4.  Lay the groundwork for backtesting a simple trading strategy by visualizing portfolio value based on signals.

This project is a starting point for anyone interested in financial data analysis, time series processing, and algorithmic trading.

## Key Features

* **Data Loading:** Efficiently loads historical AMZN stock data from a CSV file.
* **Data Exploration:** Provides a quick overview of the dataset including head, descriptive statistics, and data types (`.head()`, `.describe()`, `.info()`).
* **Date Handling:** Converts date strings to datetime objects and sets the 'Date' column as the DataFrame index for time-series analysis.
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculates a new `diff` column representing the daily difference between 'Open' and 'Close' prices.
* **Visualization:** Plots the daily 'Open - Close' difference over time, and demonstrates a conceptual plot of portfolio value with trade signals (buy/sell points) indicated.

## Data Source

The project utilizes historical stock data for Amazon (AMZN), expected to be in a CSV file named `AMZN.csv` within the same directory as the notebook. This CSV typically contains columns such as `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, and `Volume`.

## Analysis Performed

The `amzn.ipynb` notebook performs the following key analytical steps:
* Imports `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization.
* Reads `AMZN.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
* Displays the first few rows, descriptive statistics, and information about the DataFrame.
* Converts the 'Date' column to datetime objects and sets it as the DataFrame index.
* Calculates a new column `amzn['diff'] = amzn['Open'] - amzn['Close']`.
* Generates a plot showing the `amzn['diff']` over time.
* Includes a conceptual plot illustrating `portfolio['total']` over time with `signals.positions` marked, suggesting the application of a trading strategy and tracking of portfolio value.

## Backtesting Concept

While the full strategy implementation isn't detailed, the notebook touches upon the core idea of backtesting: applying a trading strategy to historical data to evaluate its hypothetical performance. The presence of `portfolio['total']` and `signals.positions` in the plotting section indicates an underlying simulation of trades based on certain criteria, leading to a visualization of how a portfolio might have performed over the historical period. This forms the basis for evaluating strategies before real-world deployment.

## How to Run the Notebook

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <your_project_folder>
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have the data:** Place your `AMZN.csv` file in the root directory of the project.
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (If `requirements.txt` is not provided, please see the [Requirements](#requirements) section to manually install.)
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  **Open `amzn.ipynb`:** In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open the `amzn.ipynb` file.
6.  **Run all cells:** Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially to see the analysis and plots.

## Requirements

The project relies on the following Python libraries:
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
